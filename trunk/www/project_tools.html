      This HTML is injected in all the pages within your project, so all the hyperlinks
      must be either absolute or start with '/'.
      
      The current page in the navigation bar is shown highlighted to let users know where
      he/she is. This is primarily done by the exact match between "window.location.href"
      and the link target, but the A tag can also have the optional "match" attribute,
      whose value is regular expression that indicates what pages the link should highlight.
      
      For example, the following match attribute says "overview" should be the current
      page even if you are in sub.html. This is useful for grouping a large number of pages
      under a single navigation item.
    -->
    <a href="/" match="/|/sub.html">Overview</a>
  <li>
    <a href="/source/browse/glassfish-theme/trunk/www/project_tools.html?view=markup">Sample</a>
  <!--
    If the parent LI of a submenu doesn't have a dedicated page like this,
    just use '#' as the href. This makes this submenu expandable by clicking on it.
  -->

  <ul>
    <li><a href="/a.html">doc A</a>
    <li><a href="/b.html">doc B</a>

      When the parent LI of a submenu has a link, its children only expands when
      the user is inside this menu.
